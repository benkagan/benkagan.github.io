    "\n",
    "Europe contains a vast number of ski resorts, ranging from beginner-friendly resorts suitable for a day-trip to mega resorts that have hosted international competitions. Many ski resorts play host to numerous hotels that market its proximity to the resort as a luxury. A wide variety of factors can help determine the value of one ski hotel over another. In addition to the standard factors including, but not limited to, price, customer reviews, and hotel quality, the value of a ski hotel heavily depends on factor such as the proximity to the ski resort and the ski resort's overall quality to name a few.\n",

    "In this tutorial, we will analyze data on over 400 ski hotels in Europe by performing data exploration and subsequently regression analysis and value determination."
